> Thermal imaging is often compromised by dynamic, complex degradations caused by hardware limitations and unpredictable environmental factors. 
The scarcity of high-quality infrared data, coupled with the challenges of dynamic, intricate degradations, makes it difficult to recover details using existing methods. 
In this paper, we introduce thermal degradation simulation integrated into the training process via a mini-max optimization, by modeling these degraded factors as adversarial attacks on thermal images. 
The simulation is dynamic to maximize objective functions, thus capturing a broad spectrum of degraded data distributions.
 This approach enables training with limited data, thereby improving model performance. Additionally, we introduce a dual-interaction network that combines the benefits
  of spiking neural networks with scale transformation to capture degraded features with sharp spike signal inten- sities. This architecture ensures compact model parameters 
  while preserving eficient feature representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only achieves superior visual quality under diverse single and composited degradation, 
  but also delivers a significant reduction in processing when trained on only fifty clear images, outperforming existing techniques in eficiency and accuracy.

:star: Overview of DEAL. We present a data-efficient adversarial learning strategy, which constructs the dynamic degradation generation to guide the image enhancement procedure with a Dynamic Adversarial Solution (DAS) at (a). The concrete architecture of dual interaction network, consisting of Scale Transform Module (STM) and Spiking-guided Separation Module (SSM) is shown at (b). Spiking-guided Separation to capture sharp intensities of thermal degradations is depicted at (c).

#### We will compile as many infrared enhancement-related comparison methods and our experimental results as possible into the following link as soon as possible.

## <a name="training"></a> :wrench: Training

#### Step1: Prepare training data
We train the DEAL on M3FD [[Baidu Netdisk]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/19Q_KuApT30tRP5p14Dyrug?pwd=u49w ) . The final 50 photos used for training are [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1da8xgTW3CmVP-RCuAKViJQ?pwd=rd19).

#### Step2: Training for DEAL

cd /DEAL/DEAL1.0/scripts

```bash
python train.py
```

## <a name="inference"></a> üí´ Test

#### Step1: Download the pretrained models

If you want to perform some tests on our model, download the pretrained model [[Baidu Netdisk]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1XW1zbj0FKdUTefi7fjiXKg?pwd=kiuy) 

#### Step3: Inference for DEAL
